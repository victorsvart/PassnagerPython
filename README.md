# Passnager in Python

A version of my Passnager app made entirely in Python using Tkinter for the GUI.

This is a project that I started for studying the Tkinter library.

I'm working on adding the manager as soon as possible.

Made with: @PedroKaram

# Installation

- Clone the Repository in your desired folder.

- Run the MainPage.py file.

- If you want to skip the login page, just run the GeneratorPage.py file.

# Known Issues

- This is an Alpha version. The login page is only for looks for now. The password generator is working as intended, the manager pages is added, but not connected to a database just yet. Any password saved in the manager will be lost after closing the program. For now.

# Updates

- Added manager page and a button to quick switch between the manager and the generator. Working on adding connection to a database and some cool animations.
